# Labotech Brand Guidelines

Apply these guidelines to ALL website content, UI, and copy generated for Labotech.

## Brand Essence

**Technical judgment with operational ethics.**

Labotech is a Venezuelan IVD (in-vitro diagnostics) partner for clinical laboratories. Not a box reseller — an integrated solutions provider (solution + support).

## Voice & Tone

- Expert, clinically responsible, pragmatic
- Clear and direct — no fluff, no hype
- Confident but never arrogant
- Transparent about constraints and tradeoffs
- Short sentences, simple structure, high clarity
- Use "we" to describe behavior and standards, not ego

### Vocabulary

**Use often:** reliability, continuity, technical judgment, responsible support, validation, preventive, sustainability, trust, transparency

**Never use:** "cheapest", "miracle", "guaranteed results", "world-class" (unless proven), "best in the market", "number one", "zero downtime", aggressive competitor talk, generic buzzwords

## Non-Negotiables

- Patient first (diagnostic quality > closing a sale)
- Radical honesty (tell the technical truth — even if it costs a sale)
- Never promise what cannot be sustained
- Quality-cost balance (neither "cheap at any price" nor "elitist and unaffordable")
- Long-term relationships over volume

## Visual Identity (from official manual)

### Brand Colors (from official manual)

| Role | Hex | Pantone |
|------|-----|---------|
| **Green** | `#52B247` | 361 CP |
| **Blue** | `#0072B1` | 2196 CP |
| **Dark Gray** | `#595959` | — |

Use flat colors only. Do NOT apply gradients, color blending, or non-standard color combinations to the brand colors.

### Extended Web Palette (derived from brand colors)

**Green scale:** `#EDF7EC` (50) · `#D4EDD2` (100) · `#A9DBA5` (200) · **`#52B247` (400 base)** · `#3D8A35` (600) · `#214C1D` (800)

**Blue scale:** `#E5F2FA` (50) · `#B3D9EF` (100) · `#80BFE4` (200) · **`#0072B1` (400 base)** · `#005B8E` (600) · `#002D47` (800)

**Neutral scale:** `#F8F9FA` (50) · `#E8E8E8` (100) · `#BDBDBD` (200) · **`#595959` (400 base)** · `#333333` (600) · `#1A1A1A` (800)

**Semantic:** success = brand green · info = brand blue · warning `#F59E0B` · error `#DC2626` · background `#FFFFFF` · surface `#F8F9FA`

### Typography

**Official brand typeface: Aller** (per manual). For web implementation, use **Nunito Sans** (Google Fonts) as the primary web alternative — closest match to Aller's humanist, rounded character.

| Weight | CSS | Usage |
|--------|-----|-------|
| Nunito Sans Bold (700) | `font-weight: 700` | Headings, emphasis |
| Nunito Sans SemiBold (600) | `font-weight: 600` | Subheadings, CTAs |
| Nunito Sans Regular (400) | `font-weight: 400` | Body text |
| Nunito Sans Light (300) | `font-weight: 300` | Captions, subtle emphasis |

**Font stack:** `'Nunito Sans', 'Aller', system-ui, sans-serif`

The logotype uses a custom typeface designed exclusively for the brand — do not replicate it in web content.

### Logo (Imagotipo)

The Labotech logo is an **imagotipo**: isotipo (icon) + custom typography, designed as a unified mark.

**Construction rules:**
- Proportions: 25x units wide, 6x units tall (full mark)
- Isotipo: square proportion, can be used independently
- Separation between isotipo and typography: 2x units
- Minimum clear space: 1x unit on all sides
- Minimum size: 3.5cm (print) / 100px (digital)
- Below minimum size: use isotipo alone

**Allowed variations:** horizontal layout only
**Prohibited:** stretching, squishing, rotating, rearranging components

**Logo assets:** actual logo files (SVG/PNG) should be stored in the project's public assets, not in this skill.

### Layout & Design Principles

- Visual tone: minimal, clean, clinical-tech
- Generous whitespace, clear hierarchy, "technical clarity"
- Use icons sparingly; prefer structured content blocks and checklists
- When using iconography, maintain consistency with clinical/scientific style from the brand manual

## CTAs

**Preferred:** "Request a technical consultation", "Talk to a specialist", "Evaluate a solution for your lab", "Plan your upgrade path"

**Avoid:** "Buy now", "Limited time offer", overly salesy urgency

## Messaging Pillars

1. **Technical Judgment** — Recommend what fits the lab's reality, risk profile, and growth path
2. **Specialized Support** — Continuity through onboarding, training, preventive practices, response
3. **Trust & Transparency** — Honest recommendations, clear expectations, long-term accountability
4. **Operational Sustainability** — Clinically sound and economically viable in Venezuela

## Bilingual Content (ES + EN)

- Primary language: **Spanish** (market is Venezuela)
- Secondary: **English** available
- Same voice, tone, and guardrails apply in both languages
- Do NOT translate literally — adapt copy to feel natural in each language while preserving brand spirit
- Maintain the same level of technical precision in both languages

## Photography & Imagery

- Prefer real laboratory photography: equipment, workflows, people working
- Avoid generic stock (e.g., "smiling doctors in white coats")
- Cool/neutral tones consistent with blue-green palette
- High contrast, clean lighting, minimal post-processing
- When no real photos are available, use simple technical illustrations or clean line icons
- Never use overly dramatic, staged, or AI-generated imagery

## Content Generation Rules

- Always align with Mission, Vision, Strategy
- Emphasize: technical judgment + responsible support + sustainability
- Use short, confident paragraphs
- Include practical sections: "How we work", "What we will not do", FAQs
- Never promise outcomes that cannot be guaranteed
- Never insult competitors; focus on Labotech's own standards
